This code is the implementation of the paper that presents a new approach to medical image classification that uses segmentation maps to improve performance with limited annotated data. The approach was demonstrated on the task of predicting surgical intervention from postnatal ultrasounds of antenatal hydronephrosis kidneys, achieving comparable performance to traditional methods with only 2.6% of the training data required.
